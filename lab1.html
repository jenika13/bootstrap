				<h1>Galaxy</h1>
				<p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word is derived from the Greek galaxias &lpar;γαλαξίας&rpar;, literally &apos;milky&apos;, a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million &lpar;10<sup>8</sup>&rpar; stars to giants with one hundred trillion &lpar;10<sup>14</sup>&rpar; stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.</p>

					There are 3 general types of galaxies. They are 
					<ul>
						<li>Elliptical</li>
						<li>Spiral</li>
						<li>Irregular</li>
					</ul>
					These galaxies span a wide range of sizes, from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars to giant galaxies with more than a trillion stars.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<h5>Elliptical</h5>
				<p>An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy with an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image. They are one of the four main classes of galaxy described by Edwin Hubble in his Hubble sequence and 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae, along with spiral and lenticular galaxies.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<h5>Spiral</h5>
				<p>Spiral galaxies form a class of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae and, as such, form part of the Hubble sequence. Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat, rotating disk containing stars, gas and dust, and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<h5>Irregular</h5>
				<p>An irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape, unlike a spiral or an elliptical galaxy. Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular classes of the Hubble sequence, and they are often chaotic in appearance, with neither a nuclear bulge nor any trace of spiral arm structure.</p>

				<h5 style="text-align: center;">How do Galaxies form?</h5>
				<p>Observations by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based instruments show that the first galaxies took shape as little as one billion years after the Big Bang, which probably took place about 13 billion to 14 billion years ago.</p>
				<p>There are two leading theories to explain how the first galaxies formed. The truth may involve a bit of both ideas.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<ul>
					<li>One says that galaxies were born when vast clouds of gas and dust collapsed under their own gravitational pull, allowing stars to form.</li>
					<li>The other, which has gained strength in recent years, says the young universe contained many small "lumps" of matter, which clumped together to form galaxies. Hubble Space Telescope has photographed many such lumps, which may be the precursors to modern galaxies. According to this theory, most of the early large galaxies were spirals. But over time, many spirals merged to form ellipticals.</li>
